# Chapter Two: Creating a Digitalcoin-Core VPS

To get started with Digitalcoin, you first need to set up a machine running Digitalcoin. The articles in this chapter describe how to do so, primarily by using a VPS (Virtual Private Server).

## Objectives for this Chapter

After working through this chapter, a developer will be able to:

   * Decide Between the Five Major Types of Digitalcoin Nodes
   * Create a Digitalcoin Node for Development
   * Create a Local Instance of the Digitalcoin Blockchain

Supporting objectives include the ability to:

   * Understand the Basic Network Setup of the VPS
   * Decide Which Security Priorities to Implement
   * Understand the Difference between Pruned and Unpruned Nodes
   * Understand the Difference between Mainnet, Testnet, and Regtest Nodes
   * Interpret the Basics of the Digitalcoin Configuration File
   
## Table of Contents

You don't actually need to read this entire chapter. Decide if you want to run a StackScript to set a node up on a Linode VPS (ยง2.2); or you want to set up on a different environment, such as on an AWS machine or a Mac (ยง2.3). Then, jump to the appropriate section. Additional information on our suggested setups may also be found in [Appendix I](A1_0_Understanding_Digitalcoin_Standup.md).
