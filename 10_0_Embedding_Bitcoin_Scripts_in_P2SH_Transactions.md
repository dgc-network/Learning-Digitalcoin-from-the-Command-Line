# Chapter 10: Embedding Digitalcoin Scripts in P2SH Transactions

Digitalcoin Script moves down several levels of abstraction, allowing you to minutely control the redemption conditions of Digitalcoin funds. But, how do you actually incorporate those Digitalcoin Scripts into the transactions you've been building to date? The answer is a new sort of Digitalcoin transaction, the P2SH.
