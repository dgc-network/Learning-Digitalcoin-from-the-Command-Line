# Chapter 9: Introducing Digitalcoin Scripts

To date, we've been interacting with Digitalcoin at a relatively high level of abstraction. The `digitalcoin-cli` program offers access to a variety of RPC commands that support the creation and control of raw Digitalcoin transactions that include funds, data, timelocks, and multisigs.

However, Digitalcoin offers much more complexity than that. It includes a simple scripting language that can be used to create even more complex redemption conditions. If multisigs and timelocks provided the bases of Smart Contracts, then Digitalcoin Script builds high on that foundation. It's the next step in empowering Digitalcoin.

## Objectives for This Chapter

After working through this chapter, a developer will be able to:

   * Design a Digitalcoin Script
   * Apply a Digitalcoin Script
   
Supporting objectives include the ability to:

   * Understand the Purpose of Digitalcoin Scripts
   * Understand the P2PKH Script
   * Understand How P2WPKH Works with Scripting
   * Understand the Needs for Digitalcoin Script Testing
