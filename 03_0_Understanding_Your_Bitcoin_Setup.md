# Chapter Three: Understanding Your Digitalcoin Setup

You're now ready to begin working with the `digitalcoin-cli` command-line interface. But that first requires that you understand your Digitalcoin setup and its wallet features, which is what will be explained in this chapter.

For this and future chapters, we presume that you have a VPS with Digitalcoin installed, running `digitalcoind`. We also presume that you are connected to testnet, allowing for access to bitcoins without using real funds. You can either do this with Digitalcoin Standup at Linode.com, per [ยง2.1: Setting up a Digitalcoin-Core VPS with Digitalcoin Standup](02_1_Setting_Up_a_Bitcoin-Core_VPS_with_StackScript.md), or via other means, per [ยง2.2: Setting up a Digitalcoin-Core Machine via Other Means](02_2_Setting_Up_Bitcoin_Core_Other.md).
