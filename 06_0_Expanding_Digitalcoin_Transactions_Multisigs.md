# Chapter Six: Expanding Digitalcoin Transactions with Multisigs

Basic digitalcoin transactions: (1) send funds; (2) to a single P2PKH or SegWit recipient; (3) from a single machine; (4) immediately. However, all four parts of this definition can be expanded using more complex Digitalcoin transactions. This first chapter on "Expansion" shows how to vary points (2) and (3) by sending money to an address that represents multiple recipients (or at least, multiple signers).
